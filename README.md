# Travel Agency Site

Hi! This is a project developed with the intention to  **learn** how to develope a static web site. I've recorded my screen with all the project developmented and  uploaded in my [GitHub](https://github.com/MarinaAlmeida20/Trip).

The mais goals here were basics of HTML and CSS.

The skills I have leaned from the project are:
	

 - Flexbox concepts.
	 - Basic of flexbox: flex-direction, justify-content and align-items.
 - How to integrate google maps on the web page.
	 - The contact section uses a map to show the address.
 - Media queries
	 - All the project is responsive for smatphone, tablet and desktops.
